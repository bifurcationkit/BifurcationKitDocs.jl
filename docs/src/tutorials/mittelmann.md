    The following example is exposed in Farrell, Patrick E., Casper H. L. Beentjes, and Ásgeir Birkisson. **The Computation of Disconnected Bifurcation Diagrams.** ArXiv:1603.00809 [Math], March 2, 2016. It is also treated in Michiel Wouters. **Automatic Exploration Techniques for the Numerical Continuation of Large–Scale Nonlinear Systems**, 2019.



We consider the problem of Mittelmann:

$$\Delta u + NL(\lambda,u) = 0$$

with Neumann boundary condition on $\Omega = (0,1)^2$ and where $NL(\lambda,u)\equiv-10(u-\lambda e^u)$. This is a good example to show how automatic branch switching works and also nonlinear deflation.

We start with some imports:

```@example MITT
using Revise
using DiffEqOperators, ForwardDiff
using BifurcationKit, LinearAlgebra, Plots, SparseArrays, Parameters, Setfield
const BK = BifurcationKit

# define the sup norm and a L2 norm
norminf(x) = norm(x, Inf)
normbratu(x) = norm(x .* w) / sqrt(length(x)) # the weight w is defined below

# some plotting functions to simplify our life
plotsol!(x, nx = Nx, ny = Ny; kwargs...) = heatmap!(reshape(x, nx, ny); color = :viridis, kwargs...)
plotsol(x, nx = Nx, ny = Ny; kwargs...) = (plot();plotsol!(x, nx, ny; kwargs...))
nothing #hide
```
and with the discretization of the problem

```@example MITT
function Laplacian2D(Nx, Ny, lx, ly, bc = :Neumann)
	hx = 2lx/Nx
	hy = 2ly/Ny
	D2x = CenteredDifference(2, 2, hx, Nx)
	D2y = CenteredDifference(2, 2, hy, Ny)

	Qx = Neumann0BC(hx)
	Qy = Neumann0BC(hy)

	D2xsp = sparse(D2x * Qx)[1]
	D2ysp = sparse(D2y * Qy)[1]
	A = kron(sparse(I, Ny, Ny), D2xsp) + kron(D2ysp, sparse(I, Nx, Nx))
	return A
end

ϕ(u, λ)  = -10(u-λ*exp(u))
dϕ(u, λ) = -10(1-λ*exp(u))

function NL!(dest, u, p)
	@unpack λ = p
	dest .= ϕ.(u, λ)
	return dest
end

NL(u, p) = NL!(similar(u), u, p)

function Fmit!(f, u, p)
	mul!(f, p.Δ, u)
	f .= f .+ NL(u, p)
	return f
end

Fmit(u, p) = Fmit!(similar(u), u, p)
nothing #hide
```

It will also prove useful to have the derivatives of our functional:

```@example MITT
function JFmit(x,p)
	J = p.Δ
	dg = dϕ.(x, p.λ)
	return J + spdiagm(0 => dg)
end

# compute 3-Jet
jet = BK.getJet(Fmit, JFmit)
nothing #hide
```

We need to define the parameters associated to this problem:

```@example MITT
Nx = 30; Ny = 30
lx = 0.5; ly = 0.5
# weight for the weighted norm
const w = (lx .+ LinRange(-lx,lx,Nx)) * (LinRange(-ly,ly,Ny))' |> vec

Δ = Laplacian2D(Nx, Ny, lx, ly)
par_mit = (λ = .05, Δ = Δ)

# initial guess f for newton
sol0 = zeros(Nx, Ny) |> vec
nothing #hide
```

To compute the eigenvalues, we opt for the shift-invert strategy with shift `=0.5`

```@example MITT
# eigensolver
eigls = EigKrylovKit(dim = 70)

# options for Newton solver, we pass the eigensolverr
opt_newton = BK.NewtonPar(tol = 1e-8, verbose = false, eigsolver = eigls, maxIter = 20)

# options for continuation
opts_br = ContinuationPar(pMax = 3.5, pMin = 0.025,
	# for a good looking curve
	dsmin = 0.001, dsmax = 0.05, ds = 0.01,
	# number of eigenvalues to compute
	nev = 30,
	plotEveryStep = 10, newtonOptions = (@set opt_newton.verbose = false),
	maxSteps = 100, precisionStability = 1e-6,
	# detect codim 1 bifurcations
	detectBifurcation = 3,
	# Optional: bisection options for locating bifurcations
	nInversion = 4, dsminBisection = 1e-7, maxBisectionSteps = 25)
nothing #hide
```	 
Note that we put the option `detectBifurcation = 3` to detect bifurcations precisely with a bisection method. Indeed, we need to locate these branch points precisely to be able to call automatic branch switching.

## Branch of homogenous solutions
At this stage, we note that the problem has a curve of homogenous (constant in space) solutions $u_h$ solving $N(\lambda, u_h)=0$. We shall compute this branch now.

Given that we will use these arguments for `continuation` many times, it is wise to collect them:

```@example MITT
# optional arguments for continuation
kwargsC = (verbosity = 0, plot = true,
	recordFromSolution = (x, p) -> (x = normbratu(x), n2 = norm(x), n∞ = norminf(x)),
	plotSolution = (x, p; k...) -> plotsol!(x ; k...),
	normC = norminf
	)
nothing #hide
```

We call `continuation` with the initial guess `sol0` which is homogenous, thereby generating homogenous solutions:

```@example MITT
br, = BK.continuation(Fmit, JFmit, sol0, par_mit, (@lens _.λ), opts_br; kwargsC...)
show(br)
```

You should see the following result:

```@example MITT
title!("")
```

We notice several simple bifurcation points for which the dimension of the kernel of the jacobian is one dimensional. In the above box, `δ = ( 1,  0)` gives the change in the stability. In this case, there is one vector in the kernel which is real. The bifurcation point 2 has a 2d kernel and is thus not amenable to automatic branch switching.

## Automatic branch switching at simple branch points

We can compute the branch off the third bifurcation point:

```@example MITT
br1, = continuation(jet..., br, 3,
	setproperties(opts_br;ds = 0.001, maxSteps = 40); kwargsC...)
title!("")
```

You can also plot the two branches together `plot(br,br1,plotfold=false)` and get

```@example MITT
scene = plot(br,br1,plotfold=false)
```

We continue our journey and compute the branch bifurcating of the first bifurcation point from the last branch we computed:

```@example MITT
br2, = continuation(jet..., br1, 1,
	setproperties(opts_br;ds = 0.001, maxSteps = 40); kwargsC...)
scene = plot(br,br1,br2)
```

## Analysis at the 2d-branch points (manual)

The second bifurcation point on the branch `br` of homogenous solutions has a 2d kernel. we provide two methods to deal with such case
- automatic local bifurcation diagram (see below)
- branch switching with deflation (see next section)

We provide a generic way to study branch points of arbitrary dimensions by computing a reduced equation. The general method is based on a Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction. We can compute the information about the branch point using the generic function (valid for simple branch points, Hopf bifurcation points,...)

```@example MITT
bp2d = computeNormalForm(jet..., br, 2;  verbose=true, nev = 50)
```

Note that this is a multivariate polynomials. For more information, see [Non-simple branch point](@ref).


You can evaluate this polynomial as follows `bp2d(Val(:reducedForm),[0.1,0.2], 0.01)` which returns a 2d vector or `bp2d([0.1,0.2], 0.01)`. This last expression actually returns a vector corresponding to the PDE problem.

You need to solve these equations to compute the bifurcation diagram in the neighborhood of the bifurcation point. In the present case, we do it using brute force. We suggest to use `IntervalConstraintProgramming.jl` for a more precise way.

```julia
using ProgressMeter
Nd = 200; L = 0.9
# sampling grid
X = LinRange(-L,L, Nd); Y = LinRange(-L,L, Nd); P = LinRange(-0.0001,0.0001, Nd+1)

# sample reduced equation on the grid for the first component
V1a = @showprogress [bp2d(Val(:reducedForm),[x1,y1], p1)[1] for p1 in P, x1 in X, y1 in Y]
Ind1 = findall( abs.(V1a) .<= 9e-4 * maximum(abs.(V1a)))
# intersect with second component
V2a = @showprogress [bp2d(Val(:reducedForm),[X[ii[2]],Y[ii[3]]], P[ii[1]])[2] for ii in Ind1]
Ind2 = findall( abs.(V2a) .<= 3e-3 * maximum(abs.(V2a)))

# get solutions
resp = Float64[]; resx = Vector{Float64}[]; resnrm = Float64[]
	@showprogress for k in Ind2
		ii = Ind1[k]
		push!(resp, P[ii[1]])
		push!(resnrm, sqrt(X[ii[2]]^2+Y[ii[3]]^2))
		push!(resx, [X[ii[2]], Y[ii[3]]])
	end
```

We can now plot the local bifurcation diagram as follows

```julia
using LaTeXStrings
plot(
	scatter(1e4resp, map(x->x[1], resx), map(x->x[2], resx); label = "", markerstrokewidth=0, xlabel = L"10^4 \cdot \lambda", ylabel = L"x_1", zlabel = L"x_2", zcolor = resnrm, color = :viridis,colorbar=false),
	scatter(1e4resp, resnrm; label = "", markersize =2, markerstrokewidth=0, xlabel = L"10^4 \cdot \lambda", ylabel = L"\|x\|"))
```

> This looks like a Pitchfork bifurcation with D4 symmetry

We can see that there are two types of solutions. After the bifurcation point, the solutions are of the form $(x_1,x_2) = (\pm x,\pm x)$ for some real $x$. Before the bifurcation point, the solutions are of the form $(x_1,x_2) = (\pm x,0), (0, \pm x)$ for some real $x$. Here is an example `plotsol(bp2d(resx[10], resp[10]))`

![](mittlemann4b.png)

We could use the solutions saved in `resp, resx` as initial guesses for a call to `continuation` but we turn to a different method.

!!! tip "Solutions"
    The brute force method provided all solutions in a neighborhood of the bifurcation point.


!!! info "Advanced computation"
    Instead of using brute force and computing the vector field on a grid. One can rely on `IntervalConstraintProgramming.jl` to do better using bisection. See also this [discourse post](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/nd-level-sets/38532/13) where the same example is treated by D. P. Sanders.    

## Branch switching with deflated newton (manual)

At this stage, we know what happens at the 2d bifurcation point of the curve of homogenous solutions. We chose another method based on [Deflated problems](@ref). We want to find all nearby solutions of the problem close to this bifurcation point. This is readily done by trying several initial guesses in a brute force manner:

```julia
out = zeros(Nx*Ny)
# deflation operator to
deflationOp = DeflationOperator(2, 1.0, [zeros(Nx*Ny)])

# options for the newton solver
optdef = setproperties(opt_newton; tol = 1e-8, maxIter = 100)

# eigen-elements close to the second bifurcation point on the branch
# of homogenous solutions
vp, ve, _, _= eigls(JFmit(out, @set par_mit.λ = br.specialpoint[2].param), 5)

for ii=1:length(ve)
	outdef1, _, flag, _ = @time newton(
		Fmit, JFmit,
		# initial guess for newton
		br.specialpoint[2].x .+ 0.01 .*  real.(ve[ii]) .* (1 .+ 0.01 .* rand(Nx*Ny)),
		(@set par_mit.λ = br.specialpoint[2].param + 0.005),
		optdef, deflationOp)
		flag && push!(deflationOp, outdef1)
end
```

This provides `length(deflationOp) = 5` solutions as there are some symmetries in the problem. For example `plotsol(deflationOp[5])` gives

![](mittlemann5.png)

We can continue this solution as follows in one direction

```julia
brdef1, = continuation(
	Fmit, JFmit,
	deflationOp[3], (@set par_mit.λ = br.specialpoint[2].param + 0.005), (@lens _.λ),
	setproperties(opts_br;ds = -0.001, detectBifurcation = 3, dsmax = 0.01, maxSteps = 500);
	kwargsC...)
```

If we repeat the above loop but before the branch point by using `@set par_mit.λ = br.specialpoint[2].param + 0.005`, we get 3 new solutions that we can continue

```julia
brdef2, = continuation(
	Fmit, JFmit,
	deflationOp[5], (@set par_mit.λ = br.specialpoint[2].param + 0.005), (@lens _.λ),
	setproperties(opts_br;ds = 0.001, detectBifurcation = 3, dsmax = 0.01);
	kwargsC...)
```

thereby providing the following bifurcation diagram with `plot(br,br1,br2,brdef1, brdef2,plotfold=false, putbifptlegend = false)`

## Automatic branch switching at the 2d-branch points

We now show how to perform automatic branch switching at the nonsimple branch points. However, we think it is important that the user is able to use the previous tools in case automatic branch switching fails.

The call for automatic branch switching is the same as in the case of simple branch points (see above) except that many branches are returned.

```julia
branches, = continuation(jet..., br, 2,
	setproperties(opts_br; detectBifurcation = 3, ds = 0.001, pMin = 0.01, maxSteps = 32 ) ;
	kwargsC...,
	nev = 30, tangentAlgo = BorderedPred()
	)
```

You can plot the branches using `plot(branches...)`. The branches are as follows
