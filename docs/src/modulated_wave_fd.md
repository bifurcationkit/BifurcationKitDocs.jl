# Modulated waves with Trapezoid method

This section is dedicated to the computation of modulated waves based on the Trapezoid method. Given a Cauchy problem $\frac{dx}{dt} = F(x)\tag{E},$ we have reduced the symmetries by  considering

$$\left\{
\begin{array}{l}
F(x, p) - s\cdot T\cdot x=0 \\
\langle T\cdot x_{ref},x-x_{ref}\rangle=0
\end{array}\right.\tag{FE}$$

This provides a travelling wave solution $$
