However the main drawback of this method is that the associated linear solver is not \"nice\", being composed of a cyclic matrix for which no generic Matrix-free preconditioner is known. Hence, the Trapezoid method is often used with an ILU preconditioner which is severely constrained by memory.

Also, the time stepper will automatically adapt to the stiffness of the problem, putting more time points where needed unlike the method based on finite differences which requires an adaptive (time) meshing to provide a similar property. The main drawback of the method is to find a fast time stepper, at least to compete with the method based on finite differences.

This option is useful to study ODE of small dimension.\nFor :BorderedLU, we take advantage of the bordered shape of the linear solver and use a LU decomposition to invert dG using a bordered linear solver. This is the default algorithm.\nFor :BorderedSparseInplace, this is the same as for :BorderedLU but the cyclic matrix dG is updated inplace. This method allocates much less. In some cases, this is significantly faster than using :FullLU. Note that this method can only be used if the sparsity pattern of the jacobian is always the same.\nFor :FullMatrixFree, a matrix free linear solver is used for dG: note that a preconditioner is very likely required here because of the cyclic shape of dG which affects negatively the convergence properties of GMRES.\nFor :BorderedMatrixFree, a matrix free linear solver is used but for Jc only (see docs): it means that options.linsolver is used to invert Jc. These two Matrix-Free options thus expose different part of the jacobian dG in order to use specific preconditioners. For example, an ILU preconditioner on Jc could remove the constraints in dG and lead to poor convergence.

L. Beentjes, and Ásgeir Birkisson. “The Computation of Disconnected Bifurcation Diagrams.” ArXiv:1603.00809 [Math], March 2, 2016. http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00809.\n\nDepending on the options in contParams, it can locate the bifurcation points on each branch. Note that you can specify different predictors using tangentAlgo.\n\nArguments:\n\nF is a function with input arguments (x, p), where p is the set of parameters passed to F, and returning a vector r that represents the functional. For type stability, the types of x and r should match. In particular, it is not inplace,\nJ is the jacobian of F at (x, p). It can assume three forms.\nEither J is a function and J(x, p) returns a ::AbstractMatrix. In this case, the default arguments of contParams::ContinuationPar will make continuation work.\nOr J is a function and J(x, p) returns a function taking one argument dx and returning dr of the same type as dx. In our notation, dr = J * dx. In this case, the default parameters of contParams::ContinuationPar will not work and you have to use a Matrix Free linear solver, for example GMRESIterativeSolvers,\nOr J is a function and J(x, p) returns a variable j which can assume any type. Then, you must implement a linear solver ls as a composite type, subtype of AbstractLinearSolver which is called like ls(j, rhs) and which returns the solution of the jacobian linear system. See for example examples/SH2d-fronts-cuda.jl. This linear solver is passed to NewtonPar(linsolver = ls) which itself passed to ContinuationPar. Similarly, you have to implement an eigensolver eig as a composite type, subtype of AbstractEigenSolver.\npar initial set of parameters,\nlens::Lens specifies which parameter axis among par is used for continuation. For example, if par = (α = 1.0, β = 1), we can perform continuation w.r.t. α by using lens = (@lens _.α). If you have an array par = [ 1.0, 2.0] and want to perform continuation w.r.t. the first variable, you can use lens = (@lens _[1]). For more information, we refer to SetField.jl,\ncontParams parameters for continuation.

It is also used in the way results are saved. It could be norm or (x, p) -> x[1]. This is also useful when saving several huge vectors is not possible for memory reasons (for example on GPU...),\nplotSolution = (x, p; kwargs...) -> nothing function implementing the plot of the solution,\ncallbackN callback for newton iterations. see docs for newton. Can be used to change preconditioners or affect the newton iterations. In the deflation part of the algorithm, when seeking for new branches, the callback is passed the keyword argument fromDeflatedNewton = true to tell the user can it is not in the continuation part (regular newton) of the algorithm,\ntangentAlgo = NaturalPred() controls the algorithm used to predict the tangents along the curve of solutions or the corrector. Can be NaturalPred, SecantPred or BorderedPred,\nverbosity::Int controls the amount of information printed during the continuation process. Must belong to {0,⋯,5},\nnormN = norm norm used in the different Newton solves,\ndotPALC = (x, y) -> dot(x, y) / length(x), dot product used to define the weighted dot product (resp. norm) (x p)^2_theta in the constraint N(x p) (see below). This argument can be used to remove the factor 1/length(x) for example in problems where the dimension of the state space changes (mesh adaptation, ...),\nperturbSolution = (x, p, id) -> x perturbation applied to the solution when trying to find new solutions using Deflated Newton. You can use for example (x, p, id) -> x .+ (1 .+ 0.001 * rand(size(x)...))\n\nOutputs:\n\ncontres::Vector{ContResult} composite type which contains the computed branches.

Specify the choice of the linear algorithm, which must belong to [:FullLU, :FullSparseInplace, :BorderedLU, :FullMatrixFree, :BorderedMatrixFree, :FullSparseInplace]. This is used to select a way of inverting the jacobian dG of the functional G.\nFor :FullLU, we use the default linear solver based on a sparse matrix representation of dG. This matrix is assembled at each newton iteration. This is the default algorithm.\nFor :FullSparseInplace, this is the same as for :FullLU but the sparse matrix dG is updated inplace. This method allocates much less. In some cases, this is significantly faster than using :FullLU. Note that this method can only be used if the sparsity pattern of the jacobian is always the same.\nFor :Dense, same as above but the matrix dG is dense. It is also updated inplace. This option is useful to study ODE of small dimension.\nFor :BorderedLU, we take advantage of the bordered shape of the linear solver and use a LU decomposition to invert dG using a bordered linear solver. This is the default algorithm.\nFor :BorderedSparseInplace, this is the same as for :BorderedLU but the cyclic matrix dG is updated inplace. This method allocates much less. In some cases, this is significantly faster than using :FullLU. Note that this method can only be used if the sparsity pattern of the jacobian is always the same.\nFor :FullMatrixFree, a matrix free linear solver is used for dG: note that a preconditioner is very likely required here because of the cyclic shape of dG which affects negatively the convergence properties of GMRES.\nFor :BorderedMatrixFree, a matrix free linear solver is used but for Jc only (see docs): it means that options.linsolver is used to invert Jc. These two Matrix-Free options thus expose different part of the jacobian dG in order to use specific preconditioners. For example, an ILU preconditioner on Jc could remove the constraints in dG and lead to poor convergence. Of course, for these last two methods, a preconditioner is likely to be required.\nupdateSectionEveryStep = 1 updates the section every when mod(step, updateSectionEveryStep) == 1 during continuation\n\nNote that by default, the method prints the period of the periodic orbit as function of the parameter.
